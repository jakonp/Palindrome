# Palindrome
C++ Program that reads inputs from a text file and outputs if it is a palindrome.

The Program asks for the name of the input file and the output files at the begining of the program.

It then reads the first line of the input file to know how many lines there are to check.

The program then reads the lines of text and outputs if they are Palindromes or not in the output file.
